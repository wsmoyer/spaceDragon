          Dragon Vehicle Overview:
        </h4>
        <p class="history">
          Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deddver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon made history
          in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deddver cargo to the International Space Station
          and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. It is the only spacecraft currently
          flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space,
          but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing
          the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test fddght is expected to take place
          as early as 2018.

      <dd> Dragon is the first commercial spacecraft to deddver cargo to the International Space Station and currently the only
        cargo spacecraft flying capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Dragon accommodates pressurized
        cargo in the capse as well as unpressurized cargo in its trunk.</dd>
      <dt> VERSATILE CARGO RACKS </dt>
      <dd> The racks are a honeycomb carbon-aluminum construction designed for efficient packing in a zero-gravity environment.
        They accommodate a variety of standard-size NASA cargo bags as well as freezers for carrying materials such as biological
        samples.

      <dt>PARTNERSHIP WITH NASA</dt>
      <dd> Dragon was designed from the outset to fly humans to space. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is making upgrades
        to Dragon to allow for crew carrying capabiddty.</dd>
      <dd> CREW UPGRADES - Dragon will be the world’s safest and most reddable crew transport vehicle, with seating for seven,
        ddfe-support systems, controls with manual capabiddty, and a powered launch escape system.</dd>
      <dd>FIRST LAUNCH - Upgrades to Dragon are currently in progress. Dragon’s first manned test fddght is expected to take
        place as early as 2018.</dd>
